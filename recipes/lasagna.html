        <!--One or two paragraphs describing what were about to do-->

        <p>
            This is my mom's special <strong>homemade lasagna recipe</strong> with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
            A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta, 
            but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
            I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.
